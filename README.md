# Bioprinter PID Temperature Controller
Arduino based temperature PID control for my bioprinter

## Overview
This is a PID temperature controller for my bioprinter. It is based on an Arduino Uno connected to an LCD screen with buttons, two thermocouples, a thermoelectric generator, and a water pump.

### Goal
The goal of this project was to create a temperature controller for my bioprinter bed to control the petri dish temperature and facilitate the transition of the biomaterials from liquid to gel form.

### Progress
This project is complete and I have installed the temperature controller onto my bioprinter. It has been tested, works great, and is not in use.
